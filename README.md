# CS149 - Operating System ![icons8-c-programming](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83048295/159117681-7c33a1d6-dd16-428d-ad3d-925091e1f50a.svg)

All projects done for CS149 Operating System class in San Jose State University taught by professor Bill.

### Requirements

Make sure you have `gcc` installed on your device. These projects are written to run in Linux. However, they are also expected to run on any other operating system.

For a few projects, `valgrind` is also optinally needed to check for memory leaks

### Run Projects

Each project contains a `makefile`. You can compile to executable simply by running `make`, or you can directly run it with `make run`. If you want to clean up the executables or object files, simply run `make clean`
